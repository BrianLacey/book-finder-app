# Cloning the Repo:

NOTE: I used VSCode and Git Bash for these steps.
Using the Terminal of your choice, navigate to the location you'd like to clone this repo to.
Copy the URL of the repo and run the command `git clone` followed by the URL to clone the repo.
Using the IDE of your choice open the project `book-finder-app` at the location you cloned to in order to see the codebase.

# Installing Dependencies

NOTE: NPM was used to install packages.
To install back-end dependencies, `cd` to `src\APIs` and run `NPM install` and all necessary packages will install.
To install front-end dependencies, `cd` to `\UI` and run `NPM install` once again.

# Starting the Book Finder App:

Start the back-end server by running the command `NPM start`. It should be listening on port 8080.

To start the front-end, open a new terminal and navigate to `\UI` and run `NPM start` here as well.

# Debugging the Book Finder App:

NOTE: I used React Devtools in Chrome and Nodemon for debugging in VSCode.
to use these, install React Devtools as a Chrome extension for front-end, and navigate to the Run and Debug tab in VSCode where you can choose 'nodemon' as a launch option. CLick the play button and debugging the back-end is possible directly in VSCode.

# Enjoy the app!
